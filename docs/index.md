Chat-Webhooks is a small Python package that lets you easily interact with Google Chat's webhooks feature. Webhooks currently **only work for spaces**. If you have a direct message or legacy group chat, you won't be able to follow these steps.

You can also upgrade your legacy group chat to a space.

## Creating a Webhook

1. Select your Google Chat space and click **Manage webhooks**.
2. Enter in the name for your webhook, and optionally paste in the url for its image.
3. The screen should not display your created webhook. Click the copy symbol.
4. Save this webhook url for later use.
